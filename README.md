# cueBeam: acoustic beam simulation using Huygens's principle.


cueBeam is a Matlab/CUDA code for simulation of acoustic field pressure distribution. It calculates pressure in the frequency domain (meaning, assumes that the radiators continuously radiate) using the Huygen's principle.

This ultra-simplified propagation model enables obtaining quick estimates of pressure field shape, beam width, and side lobe amplitude, suitable for use in NDT research. It is admittedly less accurate than other published methods, but the advantage is in its speed.

Radiators are described in terms of spatial XYZ location, amplitude and phase; despite them being point-like, they physically represent perfectly baffled pistons.

Propagation medium is described in terms of wavenumber k. Radiating sources are treated as point-like. For each field probing point, the pressure value is computed by summing the contributions from each transmitter, shifted by appropriate phase delay and reduced by the particular distance between the transmitter and probed point:


    for each pixel
      	__initialize:__ pressure=complex zero;
    	for each radiator
    		distance=distance(radiator,pixel);
    		phase_shift=wavenumber*distance+radiator_phaseshift;
    		amplitdue_decayed=radiator_amplitude/distance;
    		__accumulate:__ pressure=pressure+complex(amplitdue_decayed,phase_shift);
    	end for each radiator
    	out(pixel)=abs(pressure);  % store absolute value
    end for each pixel


## Python version:
The work has just started.


## MATLAB/CUDA Version (pre-2017):

### Preparation

The following inputs are required:

1. Locations(coordinates) of the centre of radiating elements -x,y,z.
2. 'steering vector' - a complex number describing amplitude and phase of radiation for each element. The size of the SVect must be n*1
3. Wavenumber k in the medium (single frequency only)
4. Description of the location of the field probing points. There are two versions for this: planar and spherical. The planar is called XZ (planar sampling space along XZ plane), and the spherical is called Lambert, for it uses the equal-area azimuthal sampling of a hemisphere.

 These inputs should be packed into a n*6 matrix

    tx=[elemX elemY elemZ zeros() abs(SVect(:)) angle(SVect(:))];
â€‹    

### Planar sampling version

For XZ sampling, the sampling points (where pressure is calculated) is always a regular grid described by: 
* (x0,y0,z0) - location of a corner of the grid; 
* (dx,dy,dz) - distance between points, and 
* (nx,ny,nz) : number of points in each direction.  

ny=1 always in this implementation.

The way to call the calculation function is:

	img_xz = cueBeam_xz(tx',k,x0,y0,z0,nx,ny,nz,dx,dy,dz);

Note that all inputs must be of a class single. (default for Matlab is double, so conversion is needed). This is both for speed and compatibility with early CUDA cards. No ill-conditioned math is involved, so single precision numbers deliver approximately 80dB of accuracy.

### Hemisphere sampling version

For beamsim_Lambert the calling convention is simpler:

	[img_lambert lambert_x lambert_y lambert_z]=cueBeam.cueBeam_lambert(tx', k, r, density); 

This program automatically generates a mesh of points that are distributed over a hemisphere with radius R, and distance between real points "density", in such way, that the true area (and thus, energy flux) covered by a given sampling point is equal for all points. The points are then mapped(recorded on) to a flat rectangular grid, and stored as such in memory. The transformation rules are (after http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LambertAzimuthalEqual-AreaProjection.html ) . 

R is the radius of the sphere, and 'density' is an approximate linear distance between points on the sphere. The resulting resolution of the field image can be calculated by:

    number_of_points=ceil(2*pi*r/density);
    d=2*sqrt(2)/number_of_points;
    n=ceil(2*sqrt(2)/d); % note, the double scaling is needed to obtain correct rounding.
    img_lambert=zeros(n,n,'single'); 


Inverse transformation rules are used to calculate standard parallel   and central longitude on the sphere:

p.s. I know that actually, the thing that is named 'density' should be named "reciprocial of density" or "specific volume" or 'ApproximateDistanceBetweenPoints' - or something like this - in any case, the lower the number, the more pixels You get. But I needed a shorter name quickly. If you find a right single word for this term, let me know!

### Why hemisphere?

When compared to regular orthogonal grid, there are two important advantages of this approach:
1. Due to each pixel covering the same area, and thus, flux, the true power of the sidelobes can be easily integrated and compared with the power of the main lobe. This reduces error of estimating the sidelobe level for classic beamforming, and therefore is more representative of the image contrast from the operator's point of view. 
2. The points on a hemisphere are __aproximately__ equidistant from the probe's centre, meaning that the time-of-flight from the probe to these points is nearly equal. This means, that the integrated side lobe amplitude is more representative of the actual image contrast that one would get in real life with time-domain signals. This is because the signals coming in **from the side lobe directions** and **at the same time** would colide and interfere with the reflectors insonified by the main beam --- and due to this spatial-temporal collision, are difficult to separate (and normally not separated in any classic algorithm like B-scan, TFM, e.t.c).

To summarize, this fancy hemisphere sampling gives you results that are more representative of the final image quality (compared to regular 'rectangular region of a plane' sampling).
