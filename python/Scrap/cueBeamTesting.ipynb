      "Help on function colormaps in module matplotlib.pyplot:\n\ncolormaps()\n    Matplotlib provides a number of colormaps, and others can be added using\n    :func:`~matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`.  This function documents the built-in\n    colormaps, and will also return a list of all registered colormaps if called.\n    \n    You can set the colormap for an image, pcolor, scatter, etc,\n    using a keyword argument::\n    \n      imshow(X, cmap=cm.hot)\n    \n    or using the :func:`set_cmap` function::\n    \n      imshow(X)\n      pyplot.set_cmap('hot')\n      pyplot.set_cmap('jet')\n    \n    In interactive mode, :func:`set_cmap` will update the colormap post-hoc,\n    allowing you to see which one works best for your data.\n    \n    All built-in colormaps can be reversed by appending ``_r``: For instance,\n    ``gray_r`` is the reverse of ``gray``.\n    \n    There are several common color schemes used in visualization:\n    \n    Sequential schemes\n      for unipolar data that progresses from low to high\n    Diverging schemes\n      for bipolar data that emphasizes positive or negative deviations from a\n      central value\n    Cyclic schemes\n      meant for plotting values that wrap around at the\n      endpoints, such as phase angle, wind direction, or time of day\n    Qualitative schemes\n      for nominal data that has no inherent ordering, where color is used\n      only to distinguish categories\n    \n    The base colormaps are derived from those of the same name provided\n    with Matlab:\n    \n      =========   =======================================================\n      Colormap    Description\n      =========   =======================================================\n      autumn      sequential linearly-increasing shades of red-orange-yellow\n      bone        sequential increasing black-white color map with\n                  a tinge of blue, to emulate X-ray film\n      cool        linearly-decreasing shades of cyan-magenta\n      copper      sequential increasing shades of black-copper\n      flag        repetitive red-white-blue-black pattern (not cyclic at\n                  endpoints)\n      gray        sequential linearly-increasing black-to-white\n                  grayscale\n      hot         sequential black-red-yellow-white, to emulate blackbody\n                  radiation from an object at increasing temperatures\n      hsv         cyclic red-yellow-green-cyan-blue-magenta-red, formed\n                  by changing the hue component in the HSV color space\n      inferno     perceptually uniform shades of black-red-yellow\n      jet         a spectral map with dark endpoints, blue-cyan-yellow-red;\n                  based on a fluid-jet simulation by NCSA [#]_\n      magma       perceptually uniform shades of black-red-white\n      pink        sequential increasing pastel black-pink-white, meant\n                  for sepia tone colorization of photographs\n      plasma      perceptually uniform shades of blue-red-yellow\n      prism       repetitive red-yellow-green-blue-purple-...-green pattern\n                  (not cyclic at endpoints)\n      spring      linearly-increasing shades of magenta-yellow\n      summer      sequential linearly-increasing shades of green-yellow\n      viridis     perceptually uniform shades of blue-green-yellow\n      winter      linearly-increasing shades of blue-green\n      =========   =======================================================\n    \n    For the above list only, you can also set the colormap using the\n    corresponding pylab shortcut interface function, similar to Matlab::\n    \n      imshow(X)\n      hot()\n      jet()\n    \n    The next set of palettes are from the `Yorick scientific visualisation\n    package <http://dhmunro.github.io/yorick-doc/>`_, an evolution of\n    the GIST package, both by David H.
